# HTML5 Video Player

_No BS, just pure JS._

Responsive HTML5 video player written in good ol' pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I wanted to do this myself from scratch at some point, so I've compiled all my research on how one would basically go about doing this to help others, looking to build their own simple HTML5 video player. Created specifically to be simple and easy to understand.
